# MemoAgent — Simple overview (non-technical)

Demo video: https://youtu.be/e4BuAgaFtPM

What I did:
I prepared a short, non-technical README that explains what MemoAgent is, what it can do, and how to use it in everyday language. Below is a user-friendly guide you can share with people who just want to understand and try the tool — no technical steps or setup required.

What it is
MemoAgent is an intelligent video assistant you can talk to in plain language. Give it any video you have and tell it what you want — for example, make a short highlight clip, summarize what was said, remove background noise, or extract the parts that show a specific object. MemoAgent uses memory to remember preferences so it gives more consistent results over time.

Why you might use it
- Save time editing videos for social media, presentations, or reports.
- Quickly find answers inside long videos (e.g., "When does the speaker mention pricing?").
- Produce polished short clips from longer footage without learning editing software.
- Keep consistent style across many videos by saving your preferences.

How to use it (very simple)
1. Open MemoAgent (web page or app).
2. Upload the video file you want to work with.
3. Type a natural-language request — describe what you want as you would to another person.
4. Run the job and wait a short while (processing time varies).
5. Download or share the finished video, transcript, or clips.

Everyday examples you can try
- "Create a 30-second highlight reel with the most exciting moments and add upbeat music."
- "Summarize the main points from minutes 2:00 to 5:00 in one paragraph."
- "Find the moment where the presenter says 'pricing' and give me a 15-second clip around it."
- "Remove background noise and boost the speaker's voice."
- "Make a short social-media version (15s) with captions and our brand text at the start."

Tips for best results
- Be specific about time ranges or what you want featured (e.g., “from 00:01:20 to 00:02:00” or “show only scenes with the product”).
- Say if you want a particular mood or style: calm, energetic, cinematic, etc.
- If you prefer a repeatable style, save those preferences and the agent will remember them for future requests.

Privacy & safety (simple)
- Treat uploaded videos as private content. Use the built-in delete option if you want files removed.
- Check sharing options before you publish — you control who can view or download outputs.
- If sensitive information appears in a video (personal data, financial info), avoid sharing it publicly.

Frequently asked questions
Q: Do I need to know editing software?
A: No. MemoAgent is designed so you can describe what you want in plain language.

Q: Can it work with any video I have?
A: Yes — it accepts common video files. Large files may take longer to process.

Q: How long does it take?
A: It depends on the request and video length. Simple trims are fast; complex edits or generation may take longer.

Q: Will it remember my preferences?
A: Yes — it can store style preferences so future jobs match your taste.
